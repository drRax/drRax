### Hi there, I'm Rodrigo A. Carrasco.

I've been building, programming, and disassembling things since I can remember. I'm a professor in operations research at 
[Universidad Adolfo Ib√°√±ez](https://ingenieria.uai.cl/) and participate in the [Data Observatory](https://www.dataobservatory.net/). 

Using math to improve things.
