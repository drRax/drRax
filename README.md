### Hi there, I'm Rodrigo A. Carrasco.

I've been building, programming, and disassembling things since I can remember. I'm an Associate Professor at [Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) in a joint position at the [Institute of Mathematical Engineering and Computation](https://imc.uc.cl/) and the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ing.uc.cl/industrial-y-sistemas/) in the [School of Engineering](https://www.ing.uc.cl/).

Using math (and code) to improve things.
